This file documents changes that may cause problems for you when
updating the ports tree or individual ports.  We try our best to avoid
or minimize problems when we make changes, but sometimes they are
unavoidable.

You should be in the habit of checking this file after updating and
before using the ports tree.

    Affects: Entire ports tree
    Author: Matthew Veety <mveety@gmail.com>
    
    I migrated the ports tree to the new database that tracks whether
    a package is installed, when it was installed, what version was
    installed, and what architectures it was installed for.  If you're
    updating from an older version of the ports tree, be sure to run
    'mk migrate' in the root of the ports tree prior to using it.
    This will migrate your current db to the new version.  If you have
    ports installed on multiple architectures, you must update those
    packages immediately after migrating to make sure your database
    reflects your system's state.
