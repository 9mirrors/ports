This is a pascal-to-C transpiler

BUGS:
* problems compiling generated files - stricter C compiler than with the old port?
(issues: no return on int main(...) )

TODO:
* make a "test" mkfile to compile pascal files found in examples
* implement a "p2cc" compiler in rc script based on the perl version
