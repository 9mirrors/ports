9front/Plan 9 Ports Tree.

This allows automated downloading, building, and installing of bullshit
onto your Plan 9 system. The scripts are categorized by type and name, and the
contents of the directories are standardized.

Contributing
	To contribute make a zip file with the scripts to fetch, build, install,
and clean everything needed for the application, then post the zip file to
http://bitbucket.org/mveety/9front-ports/issues as a new issue. This will get
tested and accepted or rejected. The zip file should use the constants in
/sys/ports/Config/ports.conf and not have the actual program sources with it.
The program should successfully build and install. I also reccommend a README
in the file that has some information about the program that you deem as
important and a way to contact you.

Bug Reports:
	Post bugs on http://bitbucket.org/mveety/9front-ports/issues.
Patches can be included and are highly encouraged.
