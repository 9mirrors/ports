9front/Plan 9 Ports Tree.

This allows automated downloading, building, and installing of programs
onto your Plan 9 system. The scripts are categorized by type and name, and the
contents of the directories are standardized.

Contributing
	To contribute make a patch that contains the mkfile, potential patches, and
other stuff thats needed to build. If the port depends on another port that doesn't
yet exist, please create that one too. Your patch should not touch any files in
$PORTS, $PORTS/Config, or $PORTS/Mk. If it *needs* to touch files in there, please
discuss this beforehand with mveety or one of the other maintainers.

Bug Reports:
	Post bugs to 9front@9front.org
Patches can be included and are highly encouraged.
