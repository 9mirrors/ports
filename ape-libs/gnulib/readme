This package complements missing parts in APE with object files from gnulib.

As a general guideline, the gnulib library will contain functions
* not present in APE (and hopefully APE will improve so that this library can shrink)
* not present in other specialized 3rd party libraries


Current contents:

- mkstemp/mkdtemp
- fnmatch
- 


If more functionality is needed, please just send me a request for the features to include.
