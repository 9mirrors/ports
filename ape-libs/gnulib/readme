This package complements missing parts in APE with object files from gnulib.
Gnulib will act as a strict superset of APE for a more complete libc,
 so libraries for APE will work also when gnulib is included.

As a general guideline, the gnulib library will contain functions
* not present in APE (and hopefully APE will improve so that this library can shrink)
* 3rd party libraries built with gnulib will have their headers in the 
/sys/include/ape/gnulib directory to avoid dependency pollution.


Current contents:
read files/mkfile or files/apelibs/gnulib_config.h for the current objects/features included


If more functionality is needed, please just send me a request for the features to include.

TODO:
re-write or clean up/trim the installed gnulib headers (too messy to read right now)
