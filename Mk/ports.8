.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ports
and related programs allow users and administrators to install, manage, and fetch programs and sources to programs. Each port contains whats needed to fetch, build, install, and uninstall each program automatically. Ports keeps track of dependencies that need to be installed before a port is installed and what ports are installed on the system. Ports also keep a short synopsis and versioning information for each port ease finding and upgrading programs.
.SH UTILITIES
.I Ports
has a few utilities to help in using the ports tree.
.TP
.B ports/install
.PP
This utility allows users to install ports without having to go to the ports tree and can pretend to install to see if the port works.
.TP
.BI -p
Pretends to install the port. Really installs it to /tmp/ports-overlay.
.TP
.B ports/update
.PP
This utility updates the ports tree.
.TP
.B ports/setup
.PP
This utility does the initial setup for ports to allow users to start using ports. This must be run after a new installation of 9front if you want the ports tree.
.SH TARGETS
Some of the targets work recursively through the subdirectories of the ports tree or each category. This lets you install the entire ports tree, or all of the ports in a single category automatically. The targets that do this are
.B fetch, build, install, reinstall,
and
.B uninstall
.PP
The following targets are available for all mkfiles in the ports tree. The order that they're in is the order they should be run in to install or reinstall a program:
.TP
.B fetch
Fetch all of the files needed to build and install the port.
.TP
.B build
Compiles the port and does other things required to install the port.
.TP
.B install
Installs the port and registers it in the ports database. It will fail if the port already exists in the database.
.TP
.B reinstall
Installs the port but does not register it in the ports database. It will not fail if the port already exists in the database.
.TP
.B clean
Cleans the port, usually removing object files and files generated during the build and installation.
.TP
.B nuke
Removes all downloaded files and all files generated during build an install. After a port is nuked, fetch should be run before running any other target.
.TP
.B uninstall
Uninstalls all files installed during the install. Requires that the port defines $UNINSTALL, $UNINSTALLCOMMAND, or has an uninstall file.
.PP
Targets the only exist in the root mkfile or category mkfiles:
.TP
.B test
Runs the ports tree test scripts.
.TP
.B db
Creates the ports database (must be run after you install the ports tree).
.TP
.B update
Updates the ports tree against the ports mercurial repository.
